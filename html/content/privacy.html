    <p><strong>How Your Personal Information Is Collected</strong></p>

    <p>We collect Personal Information that you voluntarily give or have given through some other direct contact from
        you. For example, when you complete forms on our website. When you access our website, we may also passively or
        automatically collect additional Personal Information and non-personally identifiable data regarding the means
        you use to access our website and the content you view when you use our website, for example, via cookies on our
        website and/or device fingerprinting.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Requests for Unit Quotes</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If you request a unit price quote, you may be asked to provide Personal Information
        such as your name, address, telephone number, zip code, email address and other transactional information
        related to the desired unit purchase. Your Personal Information may be used to contact you with the requested
        quote or to request additional information. While not required, you may voluntarily provide financial
        information so that a determination can be made regarding units that meet the parameters of your requested unit
        quote or your pre-qualification for financing, if interested.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Online Unit Orders</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If you submit an online unit order, you will be required to provide Personal
        Information to complete the purchase transaction. This information includes your name, email address, shipping
        address as well as financial information to facilitate payment for the transaction and for billing purposes. If
        your online unit order is not processed correctly, your Personal Information may be used to contact you to
        finalize the transaction. In order to process a purchase transaction, it may be necessary for us to supplement
        information you provide with information we receive from third party sources to obtain approval from a financial
        lending institution. Your Personal Information may also be shared with third parties to assist with finalizing
        the purchase transaction such as shipping companies (i.e., USP, USPS, FedEx) and credit card processing
        companies. These third-party companies do not, to our knowledge, retain, share, store, or use Personal
        Information for any secondary purposes outside of the purpose of providing the required services.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Monthly Payment Calculations</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If you use the digital retailing tool to calculate your estimated monthly payment, you
        are not required to provide Personal Information unless you decide to contact the dealer to obtain additional
        information about the unit you are interested in. If you decide to contact the dealer, you will be asked to
        provide your name, email address, shipping address and phone number. Your Personal Information will be used to
        contact you regarding your inquiry.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Log Files</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user&#39;s movement,
        and gather broad demographic and geographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are only linked to
        Personal Information if you submit a form requesting additional information.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Surveys and Contests</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">From time to time, this website may offer contests or request information from you via
        surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be
        offered. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you are not obligated to
        disclose the Personal Information requested such as your name, email address, mailing address, or demographic
        information (i.e., age, zip code). If you elect to participate in a contest, the contact information provided
        will only be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will only be used for purposes of
        monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this website.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>YouTube</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Our website may access or use YouTube API Services. By using these services, you agree
        to be bound by YouTube&#39;s Terms of Service and the Google Privacy Policy. Use of YouTube&#39;s API Services

        <li><strong>Web Beacons.</strong> Pages of our website and our emails may contain small electronic files known
            as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for
            example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website
            statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server
            integrity).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Use of Your Personal Information</strong></p>

    <p>We may use or disclose the Personal Information we collect for one or more of the following business purposes:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>to operate our website and deliver the products and/or services you have requested, and for marketing
            purposes. If you do not provide Personal Information we ask for, it may delay or prevent us from providing
            products and/or services to you.</li>
        <li>for more than one legitimate interest depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your Personal
            Information. For example, if you complete an online purchase, we may collect your information to perform our
            contract with you, but we may also maintain your Personal Information after your transaction is complete so
            that we can quickly and easily respond to any questions about your order. As a result, our collection and
            processing of your Personal Information is based upon your consent, our need to perform a contract, our
            obligations under law, and/or our legitimate interest in conducting our business. A legitimate interest is
            when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information, so long as this is not overridden by
            your own rights and interests.</li>
        <li>to help diagnose problems with our server, administer the website, conduct attribution reporting,
            personalize user experiences (including advertising or certain targeted features, such as showcasing
            previously viewed units), and compile broad statistical data.</li>
        <li>to share data with trusted partners or advertisers to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or
            postal mail, provide customer support, to arrange for deliveries, or for marketing purposes. All such third
            parties are prohibited from using your Personal Information except to provide these services to us, and they
            are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</li>
        <li>to share lead data or analytics with original equipment manufacturers with whom we partner. This data may be
            shared with original equipment manufacturers so they can perform statistical analysis and measure dealer
            performance.</li>
        <li>to create, maintain, customize, and secure your account with us.</li>
        <li>to inform you of other products or services available from us or our affiliates.</li>
        <li>to contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new
            services that may be offered.</li>
        <li>to assist you in locating a dealer near you.</li>

            changes to this Privacy Policy, or to send you website and service announcement updates which contain
            important information about the service. We may also communicate with you to provide requested services and
            in regard to issues relating to their account via e-mail or phone.</li>

        Personal Information, or if you direct us to disclose your Personal Information to third parties.</p>
